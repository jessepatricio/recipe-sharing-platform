# Recipe Form Persistence Fix

## Issue
When saving a recipe, if there was an error (like the constraint violation), the form values for title, description, and cooking_time were being cleared, forcing users to re-enter all their data.

## Root Cause
The form was using `defaultValue` for input fields instead of controlled components, which meant:
1. Form state was not preserved when errors occurred
2. Values were lost on form re-render
3. Users had to re-enter all data after any error

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Controlled Components
Changed from `defaultValue` to controlled `value` and `onChange`:

```tsx
// Before (uncontrolled)
<Input
  defaultValue={initialData?.title || ""}
  name="title"
/>

// After (controlled)
<Input
  value={title}
  onChange={(e) => setTitle(e.target.value)}
  name="title"
/>
```

### 2. State Management
Added state variables for all form fields:

```tsx
const [title, setTitle] = useState<string>(initialData?.title || "");
const [description, setDescription] = useState<string>(initialData?.description || "");
const [cookTime, setCookTime] = useState<number>(initialData?.cookTime || 0);
const [category, setCategory] = useState<string>(initialData?.category || "");
const [difficulty, setDifficulty] = useState<string>(initialData?.difficulty || "");
```

### 3. Hidden Inputs
Added hidden inputs to ensure form data is properly submitted:

```tsx
<input type="hidden" name="title" value={title} />
<input type="hidden" name="description" value={description} />
<input type="hidden" name="cookTime" value={cookTime} />
<input type="hidden" name="category" value={category} />
<input type="hidden" name="difficulty" value={difficulty} />
```

### 4. Improved Success Condition
Fixed the success condition to prevent showing success when there are errors:

```tsx
// Before
if (state.success) { ... }

// After
if (state.success && !state.error) { ... }
```

### 5. Loading State
Added loading state to prevent multiple submissions:

```tsx
const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);

// In formAction
setIsSubmitting(true);
try {
  const result = await createRecipe(formData);
  return result;
} finally {
  setIsSubmitting(false);
}

// In submit button
<Button disabled={isSubmitting}>
  {isSubmitting ? "Saving..." : "Create Recipe"}
</Button>
```

## Benefits

### ✅ **Form Persistence**
- All form values are preserved when errors occur
- Users don't lose their work due to validation errors
- Better user experience with fewer frustrations

### ✅ **Better UX**
- Loading state prevents multiple submissions
- Clear feedback during form submission
- Form values persist across re-renders

### ✅ **Data Integrity**
- Hidden inputs ensure all data is submitted
- Controlled components prevent data loss
- Proper state management throughout the form

## Files Modified

1. **`components/recipes/recipe-form.tsx`**
   - Added state variables for all form fields
   - Converted to controlled components
   - Added hidden inputs for form submission
   - Improved success condition
   - Added loading state

## Testing

The form now:
- ✅ Preserves all values when errors occur
- ✅ Shows loading state during submission
- ✅ Prevents multiple submissions
- ✅ Maintains data integrity
- ✅ Provides better user feedback

## Result

Users can now:
- Fill out the form completely
- Submit and see errors without losing their work
- Fix errors and resubmit without re-entering data
- See clear feedback during the submission process
